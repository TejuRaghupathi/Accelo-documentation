# Accelo-documentation- This document is to provide info regarding what i'm currently working.

Hello Team,

I'd want to extend my gratitude to giving me an oppurtunity to shhowcase any working projects.
Although I have few single projects that can already been showcased, I knew I wasn't satified with what I already have.
Hence, Two days ago, I started to work on few more projects that can be help me prove my learning ability.
These projects maybe at an elementary level for an experienced person, but for me, starting it from scratch alongside learning to understand what can be done differently and to modify is so satisfying.
This is the most efficicent way of learning for me and that is why I want to shhowcase these projects, although they are basic and needs to be devloped further.

If there is any further information that I'm able to provide, I'm keen to do so.
I'd really appreciate your review and feedback.

Thank you, again.
